In your most recent experiment you mixed two different gases. The chemical reaction made the temperature in the reaction tube vary over time, which was measured with 3 different thermometers. You're now back in your office and ready to analyse your data, which is available in a csv file\n",

To improve the likelihood that she'll have a look to see if there's something wrong with the temperature sensors you'll plan to create a nice slide deck.
