Keep the data set an arm's length (i.e. don't look at it - the point is that you'll become too focused about what exactly you can do with your data set rather than what insights you hope to gain) and write down questions that arise in your mind when you think about this data set. What insights do you think/hope this data set can give you? At this stage, it is very important to be in the open mode where you don't write off any questions because you think they're too obvious/not good enough/too complicated to answer/any other reason. Write down every single thought, do.not.discard.any.ideas/questions!\n",
